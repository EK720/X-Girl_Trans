「Kiyomi」
Anna...
「Anna」
You're late. You knew I was suspicious all along, didn't you?
「Kiyomi」
So, it was you after all...
「Anna」
That's why you're here. Isn't it? What are you doing? Hurry up and arrest me.
「Kiyomi」
Aren't you going to explain?
「Anna」
I don't care. I don't want to think about anything anymore...
「Kiyomi」
Hand over the information you pulled from the database. If we just get that back, we won't need to bother with torture.
「Anna」
I don't have it.
「Kiyomi」
I'm saying this for your own good. If you think you can keep it hidden from me, you'd better reconsider.
「Anna」
I said I don't have it!
「Anna」
I hate you all. Why are you Japanese treated as special? Can't immigrants be good enough?
「Kiyomi」
I never said that. Just hand it over already!
「Anna」
No way. I'm taking this information back to Russia.
「Kiyomi」
You can't be serious... Are you saying you're a spy?
「Anna」
So what if I am? Want to torture me to make me talk?
「Kiyomi」
Guess we have no choice...
「Kiyomi」
Looks like we really have to do this. I hate to do this to Anna, but...
「Kiyomi」
If you manipulated the prisoners yourself to steal intel from the military, why did you dump this mission on me?
「Anna」
............
「Kiyomi」
Did you think I'd abandon the mission midway, figuring I wouldn't be in danger?
「Kiyomi」
Or did you plan to have April or Reifa kill me? You couldn't possibly think I could beat those two, right?
「Anna」
N-no! That's not it!
「Kiyomi」
Well then, I'd like you to explain what it is. How about you give me some kind of explanation?
「Anna」
............
「Kiyomi」
Why are you silent? Do you want to be tortured like the other prisoners? Do you think I can't do it?
「Anna」
............
「Anna」
Stop spouting nonsense. Just torture me already, won't you?
「Kiyomi」
What did you say...
「Anna」
I said just torture me already.
「Anna」
I won't say a word. You seem to think you're a pro, but you're nothing but a delusional fool.
「Anna」
Kiyomi, you're nothing but a sadist. Just an amateur who enjoys torture.
「Kiyomi」
You want to call yourself a pro? Why did you delete the information from the database? Doing something like that was bound to get us caught.
「Kiyomi」
If you're a pro thief, you wouldn't delete it. You'd just make a copy. That's the standard way to do it, isn't it?
「Anna」
............
「Kiyomi」
That doesn't matter. There's more to it than that. If we keep this up, we won't even get a trial. Kato will have us at his mercy!
「Anna」
That doesn't matter! Hurry up and do it!
「Kiyomi」
But…
「Anna」
That's your only redeeming quality, isn't it? You genuinely love seeing people suffer, you're a true psychopath!
「Anna」
Yes, that's right. I thought April or Reifa would kill you. I was absolutely convinced you'd fail the mission.
「Kiyomi」
Cut it out. Shut your mouth.
「Anna」
Maybe it would've been better to let Morii kill you!
「Anna」
The bodies were disposed of by the organ dealer, leaving not even bones behind. I hid the two of them in Chiba because I thought you'd be too afraid to do anything.
「Anna」
Enough with the excuses. I don't want your sympathy. Just torture me already, won't you?
Anna's pale face in the Podmod looked even more ashen than usual.
You must have known I'd come here since Pris was interrogated. Maybe that's why you look so pale...
But if you knew, why didn't you escape? You weren't under arrest. You could have left anytime.
Anna is trying hard to appear calm. At this rate, I doubt she'll reveal where the hidden software is.
But can Anna, so frail and sickly, endure my interrogation?
If I interrogated her seriously, Anna might die. Or perhaps that is what Anna desires?
Could this frail, sickly Anna endure my interrogation? At worst, she might die...
Outside the window, the rain had finally begun. The rain falling on this city is nothing but waste products from the steam and various production activities generated within it.
They say it's harmless, but how much can you trust that? Being drenched in this rain is horrifying. Better not to go outside.
Cold seeps through the window glass into the room. It feels like it could turn to snow any moment.
How many years has it been since I last saw snow? Since I was a child. Anna must have seen it for the first time since abandoning her homeland too...
Someone who understands our current situation is doing this deliberately. Am I delusional to think this idea isn't entirely false?
Outside the window, it has finally turned to rain. The rain falling on this city is nothing but waste products like steam generated within the city and various industrial byproducts.
Kato mentioned the remaining information. If we can just recover the system software, we won't need to interrogate Anna.
Will Anna agree to my persuasion? If not, I'll truly have to resort to torture...
Why did Anna tamper with the military's database? Why won't she say anything about it at all...?
Anna wouldn't do something like that for no reason. Is she refusing to explain because she doesn't trust me?
If this continues, I'll genuinely have to interrogate Anna. Her body probably couldn't withstand torture.
