「Katou」
Is something wrong, Major?
「Katou」
Is something wrong, Major?
「Kiyomi」
Oh, something's wrong all right. You didn't think I was looking forward to seeing you, did you?
「Katou」
Well, well... I'm terribly unpopular. It's part of the job, but it's pretty tough.
“Kiyomi”
Don't play the saint. I've never met a scumbag like you before.
“Katou”
...So, what's this about?

“Kiyomi”
We captured April. We're about to interrogate her.
“Katou”
Well done. Report to me as soon as you learn anything.
“Kiyomi”
I tortured April, but she didn't spill a word.
“Katou”
Hmm... No choice then. Capture the other former special forces operative. Quickly.
“Kiyomi”
I interrogated April and captured Reifa. I plan to interrogate Reifa next.
“Katou”
If you can't get anything out of her, I'll have to question your so-called special skills.
“Kiyomi”
Got April and Reifa. Interrogating them now. Hope they talk.
“Katou”
Good initiative to report back properly. If you ever need my help or the military's, just say the word.
“Kiyomi”
We captured Reifa. She was hiding in Chinatown, just as I suspected.
“Katou”
It's almost as if she wanted us to catch her. Can't help but find that suspicious. Stay vigilant.
“Kiyomi”
We got nothing out of Reifa. I don't think my interrogation was too lenient. Maybe she really doesn't know anything.
“Katou”
I don't think so. Too bad. Capture the other former special forces member. Quickly.
“Kiyomi”
I couldn't get anything out of Reifa. She knows nothing. What if April is the same? What then?
“Katou”
You and Colonel Anna will take responsibility. If you don't want that, then do something about it.
「Katou」
Coming back empty-handed is disappointing. You still haven't fulfilled your duty. Go capture the prisoner quickly.
「Kiyomi」
Continuing from before, I want to know why you kept quiet about the goggles and prisoner markings.
「Katou」
Still bringing that up? I told you I forgot.
「Kiyomi」
I can't believe you'd say that. If I'd known, I wouldn't have gone through all this trouble!
「Katou」
Believe it or not, it's up to you. But if you don't trust me, it'll only make the job harder.
「Kiyomi」
Oh, really? Think I'd be scared?
「Katou」
Don't get the wrong idea. I'm not threatening you. I've been given full authority over this case by the military. That's why I'm telling you to trust me.
「Kiyomi」
Oh, “so trust me”? You've got to be kidding me. I can't trust someone like you.
「Kiyomi」
In fact, I suspect you. I wonder if you're deliberately slowing down the investigation.
「Katou」
What nonsense...
「Kiyomi」
Oh? I don't think it's that far-fetched. Want me to leak it somewhere?
「Kiyomi」
If it turns out you, the Internal Affairs auditor, are the mastermind behind the leak, you won't get off scot-free.
“Katou”
Do whatever you want. You're the one who'll be humiliated.
“Katou”
If you've got time to spout such nonsense, wrap up this case already.
Standing tall before me, Katou radiates an overwhelming presence. His bulging muscles are visible even through his uniform.
But despite that enviable physique, his mind is utterly rotten.
Katou is definitely a nasty piece of work. Yet, it's clear at a glance that this man has undoubtedly built the finest career as a soldier.
His honed physique must have been forged through countless battlefields, and his cold eyes are indistinguishable from those of a killer.
Standing before me, the tall Katou radiates an overwhelming sense of intimidation beyond imagination. His bulging muscles are visible even through his military uniform.
First, let's interrogate April. We might find the key to unlocking this entire case.
Even if that fails, perhaps we can gain hints to arrest Reifa or clues to discover a third prisoner.
I refuse to believe April endured my torture. Did she truly know nothing...?
The second prisoner, Reifa, has been arrested. Interrogating her might yield some information.
Both prisoners have been arrested. Interrogating them should reveal classified information.
Reifa has been arrested. Interrogating her might uncover the key to solving the entire case.
I refuse to believe Reifa endured my interrogation. Did she truly know nothing...?
Reifa said nothing. I have to do something about April. Anything... I have to do something...
First, I must arrest either April or Reifa. Which one should I go after first...?
Kato shows no remorse whatsoever, but keeping the marking on that prisoner from me is a mistake he deserves to be blamed for.
It's not something that can be dismissed with a simple “I forgot.” For starters, forgetting something that important is unbelievable.
I still can't trust Kato. There's definitely something behind this...
Kato shows no sign of remorse whatsoever, but keeping the matter of the marking on that prisoner from me is a mistake he deserves to be blamed for.
