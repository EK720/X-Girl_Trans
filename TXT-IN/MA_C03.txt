Anna seems to be in the office.
She's not in the room. Probably over in the office.
“Kiyomi”
Anna, you were here...
“Anna”
Kiyomi... What's wrong? You look down.
“Kiyomi”
You don't look too cheerful yourself. Then again, spending every waking moment with Kato would make anyone lose their cheer.
“Anna”
That's not it...
“Anna”
On days like this, with this awful weather, the other personality inside my head wakes up. I suppose someone like you, Kiyomi, without the wiring in your brain, wouldn't understand?
“Kiyomi”
If that's a sensation only people who've undergone Podmod feel, then I can imagine it. If it's just feeling down, I get that.
“Anna”
It's a little different... So, what do you want?
Anna is nowhere to be seen. Where did she go...?
 　Movement　 
 　　My Room

“KIYOMI”
Based on the information from April and Reifa, we're searching Chiba. To find the remaining two prisoners.
“ANNA”
Right... Chiba City. Even though it's a mission, I hate sending you to Chiba.
“KIYOMI”
Well, yeah. It's certainly not what you'd call a wonderful city, to put it mildly. Have you ever been to Chiba, Anna?
“ANNA”
What do you think I did to my brain wiring? Back then, the only place that could operate on me—a civilian—was a black market clinic in Chiba.
“KIYOMI”
Now that you mention it... Yeah... It's only been in the last few years that civilians could openly get cybernetic treatments.
“Anna”
Even so, if I were told to get wiring done on my brain now, I'd still go to Chiba.
“Kiyomi”
Why... exactly?
“Anna”
Because they have the latest tech. The absolute cutting edge, not yet publicly available. How they got it, I have no idea.
“Kiyomi”
................................
“Anna”
We got off track. So... what happened in Chiba?
“Kiyomi”
Well, the Information Bureau's authority doesn't hold there. All the residents are suspicious of me, an outsider.
“Anna”
Back in the day, I heard that a lot too. They said there were only two kinds of people in Chiba: suckers and the con artists waiting for them...
“KIYOMI”
Yeah, so... it's hopeless. At this rate, it'll take us a lifetime to find those two.
“ANNA”
That's a problem.
“KIYOMI”
You don't sound very concerned... you're taking it pretty easy...
“ANNA”
That's not true. So, what are you planning to do?
“KIYOMI”
I met a woman in Chiba. Her name is Morii. She runs a shady establishment in Chiba. Seems she's also an informant.
“Anna”
Chiba... Mori.
“Kiyomi”
Mori seemed to know something. About the prisoners we're looking for.
“Anna”
How could that be possible? I can't imagine Nana and Mitsuko doing anything conspicuous... even if they are amateurs.
“KIYOMI”
Even if he doesn't know anything yet, Morii could find them. He's apparently quite a figure in Chiba's underworld.
“ANNA”
...Chiba's Morii.
“ANNA”
He certainly seemed well-connected in the underworld.
“KIYOMI”
Anna, do you know anything about that woman?
“ANNA”
That doesn't matter. So, let's just have Morii find the two prisoners.
“KIYOMI”
The thing is... it seems it won't be free. Will the military pay?
“ANNA”
Probably not. Besides, Morii knows we're from Intelligence, right? He'll demand a huge sum.
「Kiyomi」
So what should I do then?
「Anna」
Hmm... I have an idea. Let's go to the office.
“Kiyomi”
Huh... What are you planning?
“Anna”
We need to talk to Kato. It'll be fine. Come on.
I've never heard it before, but how old is Anna? If she really is a former KGB agent like the rumors say, she must be much older than me.
It's not just immigrants—this city is full of people like Anna, whose pasts are unknown. They seem to be just one step away from immortality.
Her body was so delicate it seemed it might break if touched, her skin astonishingly pale from the Podmod... She didn't look tough from any angle.
For Anna to climb to such a high position in the Intelligence Division must have taken extraordinary effort.
I've never heard it before, but how old is Anna? If she really is a former KGB agent like the rumors say, she must be much older than me.
Anna's private room was located lower than mine, offering a less impressive view.
Overgrown tree branches blocked the sightline, making it nearly impossible to discern what lay outside.
The heat radiating from people's bodies and the moisture from other mundane activities drifted outside the window as a mist of water vapor.
It felt like rain was imminent. Those who managed the city had long since ceased any effort to control such phenomena.
Anna's private room is located lower than mine, and the view isn't particularly good.
From the testimonies of the other three prisoners, it's clear Mitsuko was the one who suggested stealing military secrets.
However, it's also clear someone was manipulating them from behind the scenes. Mitsuko must know who that person is.
I feel like I'm finally beginning to grasp the rhythm and color governing this entire incident. At this rate, the mission should conclude soon.
Interrogating Mitsuko should reveal the existence of the mastermind manipulating them behind the scenes.
Nana arranged to meet Mitsuko on the subway connecting Tokyo and Chiba. Going there should allow us to capture Mitsuko.
Unlike April or Reifa, Nana is just a former soldier. Torture should make her talk easily...
Did Anna know Morii? She said to go to Morii's shop...
The woman we met at that shady shop in Chiba... Morii... Seems Morii is quite a well-known figure in Chiba's underworld too.
She seemed to know something about the two of them too. But the authority of the military or intelligence branches holds no sway in Chiba.
Using brute force doesn't seem like a good idea against that woman either... How can we get Morii to talk?
Morii seems to know something about Nana and Mitsuko. Even if not, she can get information in Chiba. We have to find a way to get her on our side.
According to what April and Reifa told me, it seems Mitsuko, who used to be a secretary to a high-ranking military official, was the one who recruited them.
And Mitsuko and Nana were lovers. The story that the two of them are hiding out together in Chiba doesn't seem entirely false.
My next task is to capture Nana and Mitsuko. They seem to have fled into Chiba City. But...
Chiba is a lawless zone abandoned by both the government and the military, a place where even the prestige of the Intelligence Division doesn't reach. Finding them is out of the question... my own life might be at stake...
My next task is to capture Nana and Mitsuko. They seem to have fled into Chiba City. But...
